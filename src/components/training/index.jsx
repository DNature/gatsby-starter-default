                The degree of success recorded by public or privates organizations in archiving their set target depends
                on the strategic management skills exhibited by Senior Management Staff. With the ever changing roles of
                organizations, it is imperative that their executives are able to strategically orient their endeavours
                in the right direction. This workshop is therefore designed to teach participants to think globally,
                compete locally and internationally as well as implement a customer/clients focused strategy for their
                respective organizations.
